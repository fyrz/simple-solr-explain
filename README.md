[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fyrz/simple-solr-explain.png)](https://travis-ci.org/fyrz/simple-solr-explain) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/fyrz/simple-solr-explain/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/fyrz/simple-solr-explain?branch=master)

## Motivation

This project aims to provide Solr query explanations to a broader audience. In former and current projects as well as by experience debug information available via standard Solr facilities are too detailed and too technical to be easily understandable.

## Usage

Simple solr explanations can be integrated by configuring it as a custom Solr QueryResponseParserPlugin or by using standalone with API calls.
